                        <p>
                            During my time at Paris-Saclay University, I worked on a challenging research project in collaboration with three other students under the supervision of Dr. Anna Rozanova-Pierrat. Our objective was to analyze and improve mathematical models related to acoustic wave propagation in cylindrical domains, specifically in the context of reducing jet engine noise. By utilizing a modified Myers boundary condition, we explored its effects on sound absorption and optimized the material distribution on the engine's boundary to minimize acoustic energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The study focused on proving the well-posedness of the problem, derived from the Euler equations, using mathematical tools such as Fredholm’s alternative, Green’s formula, and the trace operator. Additionally, we characterized physical parameters and established an optimization framework for the distribution of absorbing materials, ensuring mathematical rigor through variational formulations and measure-theoretic approaches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This research combined theoretical and applied mathematics, with applications in aeronautics to address industrial challenges such as improving liner designs for jet engines. While the scope of the project was broad, our results contributed both to mathematical theory and practical benchmarks, culminating in a research article currently under review for publication.

                            As a French student in a French university, I was not directly an international student, but I quickly became aware of the challenges faced by international students at CentraleSupélec. Many of these students, coming from diverse educational systems, had not gone through French scientific preparatory classes typically required for entry into the university. As a result, some of them struggled to follow the courses, especially in mathematics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To support them, I started by organizing supplemental lectures in large amphitheaters to review essential theorems and classical concepts taught in preparatory classes. Later, I worked on training exercises and mock exams to help them prepare for their December mathematics exams (which was also mine). Over time, I expanded these efforts to cover other subjects, such as physics and engineering sciences, ensuring a more comprehensive academic support system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Motivated by these interactions, I took on the role of representing international students to the university administration. My goal was to advocate for their needs and raise awareness about the difficulties they encountered, fostering better communication and understanding between the administration and the international community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, as a member of the association’s executive board, I helped organize numerous events, including a dedicated integration week for over 300 international students. Throughout the year, I was also involved in other activities aimed at creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This year-long experience was incredibly fulfilling. It allowed me to support my peers, develop strong leadership and organizational skills, and forge unforgettable memories and friendships with people from all over the world.

                            During the Fall semester, I served as a teaching assistant for first-year students in the bachelor program jointly run by CentraleSupélec and McGill University. I supported students in mastering fundamental concepts in classical mechanics. My responsibilities included assisting in the design of exercises and solutions, guiding students during lab sessions, and grading their homework assignments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Spring semester, I transitioned to teaching quantum mechanics to third-year engineering students, a level just one year below my own. My role included creating and grading multiple-choice questions (MCQs), correcting exercises, addressing student questions outside of class, and designing a full problem set for a tutorial session based on one of the course’s key chapters. This required a deep understanding of the material and the ability to convey complex ideas effectively.

                            This internship was part of the mandatory worker internship requirement for my degree at CentraleSupélec. My primary role involved assisting technicians with manual tasks in the workshops, gaining hands-on experience in the operational processes of the site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my free time, I initiated a personal project aimed at synthesizing risks across multiple workshops on the site. These risks were detailed in individual Excel files, which were challenging to manage manually. I developed a Python program capable of automatically reading these Excel files, extracting the risks and related remarks, and compiling them into a centralized Excel document. This automation significantly improved the efficiency of risk management and reduced manual effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The program was initially deployed in the department where I worked. Upon completing my internship, I heard it had been adopted across all departments at the Dijon site, extending its impact beyond my original scope.
